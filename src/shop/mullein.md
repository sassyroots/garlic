Mullein (Verbascum thapsus) has long been used as a natural remedy to support lung health. The leaves and flowers of the mullein plant contain compounds with expectorant properties, which can help loosen and expel mucus from the respiratory tract. This makes mullein an excellent choice for individuals dealing with respiratory issues such as coughs, bronchitis, or asthma. Additionally, mullein is known for its soothing and anti-inflammatory effects, which can provide relief to irritated airways. 

This tincture format makes it easy to take on the go. It can be used orally or with a nebulizer.
